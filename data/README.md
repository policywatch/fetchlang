When designing a domain-specific language, and domain-data is
available, we can employ data analysis to guide our design.

This directory is intended for data analysis related to FetchLang.

The data we have comes from predecessor/competitor service called
[TOSBack](https://tosback.org/). The [development of this
service](https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2) does not seem to be
active, but they do have a fairly extensive repository of crawlers. We
can mine these crawlers to see how they look.
