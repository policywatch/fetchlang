# FetchLang

FetchLang is a concise, standalone, domain-specific language for
fetching the terms and policies of Internet-based services. In simpler
terms, it is a language for writing a particular class of web
crawlers.

## Why?

Although terms and policies tend to have a human-readable text-like
form, with only lightweight (HTML) markup, there is some variety in
their layout. To let PolicyWatch encompass the largest possible number
of Internet-based services, we could employ a fair number of targeted
web crawlers. Authoring and maintaining these crawlers, can be left to
(occasionally paid) volunteers.

A concise, standalone, domain-specific language for authoring these
crawlers can enable the largest number of people to contribute, and
ensure the security of our infrastructure: By designing our own
language, we control the learning curve, and all the degrees of
freedom within the language.
